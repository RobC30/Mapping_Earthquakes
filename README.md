## Earthquake Mapping

## Overview
The objective of this project is to create a mapping tool that visualizes all recorded seismic activities throughout the obeserved areas of the U.S. Department of Interior Geological Survey (USGS). To give us a better understanding on where earthquakes usually occur, we also mapped Earth's tectonic plates as an overlay.

## Results
One major takeaway from this tool is most major earthquakes (classified as magnitudes greater than 5.0) seem to lie on the edges of the planet's tectonic plates. Earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 6.0, lie on the edges of at least 2 tectonic plates while most lie on at least 3 tectonic plates. This further helps our theory that major earthquakes are more likely to happen on these areas.
